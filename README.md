# Ditp (Flutter) Introduction

A Flutter app which presents itself as a slides slideshow. It showcases the functionality of Flutter as well as providing a small introduction to the platform/SDK.

## WARNING: "MY FIRST FLUTTER APP" CODE AHEAD

This project has been made as a trial for Flutter by yours truly. Many best practises have been ignored, in favor of speedy results and learning. Bad code and implementations are thus to be expected.
