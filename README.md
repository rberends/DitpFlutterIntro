# Ditp (Flutter) Introduction

A Flutter app which presents itself as a slides slideshow. It showcases the functionality of Flutter as well as providing a small introduction to the platform/SDK.

## WARNING: "MY FIRST FLUTTER APP" CODE AHEAD

This project has been made as a trial for Flutter by yours truly. Many best practises have been ignored, in favor of speedy results and learning. Bad code and implementations are thus to be expected.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Opening the Project

I personally mainly used Android Studio to code this together. Cloning/downloading the repo and opening the folder as a project on Android studio should this be sufficient to make it all work. Your mileage with other IDEs may vary and may require further tinkering.

The main entrypoint for this app is in <b>lib/main.dart</b>
